# Workout Calendar Web Component

The Workout Calendar is a custom web component that provides a user-friendly interface for tracking daily workout activities. Some of the key features include:

## Calendar Visualization
The component displays a calendar grid showing the current month. Each day in the calendar is represented as a clickable tile that displays the user's workout details for that day, if any.

## Workout Tracking
Users can log their daily workouts by clicking on a calendar day. This opens a modal where they can input the number of pushups, pullups, abs exercises, and squats performed that day.

## Workout History
All logged workouts are stored in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to view their past workout data even after refreshing or revisiting the page.

## Workout Intensity Indicators
The calendar tiles use a color-coded system to visually indicate the intensity of the user's workouts. Tiles with higher total exercise counts are displayed in darker shades of green, while lower intensity workouts use lighter green hues.

## Navigation
The component provides buttons to allow the user to navigate to the previous or next month in the calendar view.

## Current Day Highlighting
The current day is highlighted with a yellow background to help the user easily identify today's date.

Overall, the Workout Calendar component provides a straightforward and engaging way for users to log, view, and track their daily workout routines. The visual calendar format coupled with the workout intensity indicators make it easy for users to quickly assess their fitness progress over time.
